Question1) For, while, and d0- while are the three main forms of iteration constructs used in programming. While each of these constructs can produce the same outcome,
their syntaxes and optimal applications vary.for loop is frequently used when working with arrays since it makes it simple to iterate through an array's elements using an index variable. 
A for loop's syntax is also shorter and easier to read than the syntax of the other two constructions.
The while loop is useful when you don't know how many iterations you'll need or when you need to loop until a certain condition is met
do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it ensures that the loop body is executed at least once before checking the loop condition.
                  In the provided workshop 6, we mainly use the for loop (The loop starts from i=0 and continues till i<Wish_List_Items)  to Perform array indexing and  end the loop early or skip certain elements based on a condition.
   When working with arrays, the for loop is also often more effective than other loop types since it allows direct access to each element via an index
   rather than requiring a conditional search for each iteration.
   
   Question2) in Visual Studio, iff there are any semantic flaws in your code, the compiler will produce errors when we run the code 
   On the window titled Error List, you can see the errors. The error messages will outline the issue and  offer recommendations for how to fix it
   usually when there are syntatic errors such as missing semicolon or commas , when we complie the code the complier highlights the red statement with the line ssaying
   expected(;) or expected (,)and also refer to the line number of the code where erros happens and therfore we can solve the error
