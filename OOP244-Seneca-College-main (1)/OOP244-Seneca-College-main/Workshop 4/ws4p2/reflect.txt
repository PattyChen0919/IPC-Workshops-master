There are several things i learnt from this workshop-
Dynamic memory allocation: Using the new operator, I gained expertise with dynamic memory allocation. 
The labels are stored in an array of Label objects that the LabelMaker class dynamically constructs.
I became aware of the significance of effectively controlling dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.

I discovered how to define constructors, which initialise objects and deal with various argument lists.
The Label array's memory is dynamically allocated in the LabelMaker class' constructor. 
In order to deallocate the memory when the LabelMaker object exits the scope, I additionally implemented a destructor.
Labels may be read from the user and printed to the console using member functions I added to the LabelMaker class.
I iterated through the Label array using a for loop.

Throughout the workshop, I faced some challenges, such as managing dynamic memory and understanding the proper allocation and deallocation of resources.
However, by carefully studying the provided code and consulting the course notes,
I was able to overcome these difficulties and successfully implement the required functionality.
