//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

I learned how to create C++ classes to manage text files and transform them into basic HTML format in Workshop 9. 
I was able to read file contents into dynamically allocated memory using the Text class, and I used the Rule of Three to effectively manage memory during copying and assignment. 

The workshop's main objective was to create two classes, Text and HtmlText, each with its own set of functions. 
Through the Text class, I learned how to read the contents of a text file into dynamically allocated memory and access the content using the index operator[] 
In addition, I efficiently handled memory allocation and manipulation by using C-style string functions.

The write() function in HtmlText demonstrated how to convert text content into a simple HTML format, replacing specific characters with corresponding HTML entities. 
This exercise showcased the power of virtual functions, allowing dynamic binding and ensuring the appropriate write() function was called for each object.

One of the challenges I faced was understanding how to convert characters to their corresponding HTML entities in the HtmlText class. 
However, by following the provided logic and guidelines, I managed to implement the conversion successfully.
